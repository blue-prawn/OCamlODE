An OCaml interface to the ODE Physics SDK.

ODE homepage: https://www.ode.org/

ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid body dynamics.
It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform independent.
It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection with friction.
ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and
virtual creatures.
It is currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring tools and simulation tools.

This version of the bindings is known to work with ODE version 0.16
