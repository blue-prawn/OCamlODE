- 2 bugs corrected
- possible to wrap an ODE compiled with dSINGLE or dDOUBLE
- added missing functions and up-dated to the last version of ODE
- a new makefile that does not require extra dependencies
  (the original one requires extlib, findlib, lablgl, sdl)
- type constraint for each kind of geometry
- added some demos from the ODE sources converted from C to OCaml
- generating ode_version.h for versioning
